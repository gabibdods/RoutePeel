# 🧅 Deep Web Exploration with Tails OS and Tor Relays

A practical cybersecurity experiment to deepen understanding of Tor networks/relays, .onion websites, and anonymous browsing practices using the **Tails operating system**, an OS built specifically for privacy and security. This project demonstrates secure navigation of the dark web and onion services, including a connection to DuckDuckGo’s onion mirror.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Reading about Tor and the deep web provides theoretical knowledge, but I wanted **real-world, hands-on experience** with:
- Navigating .onion services securely
- Understanding how Tor relays work
- Using privacy-preserving operating systems
- Verifying digital signatures for secure system installations

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Connect securely to an **onion website** (DuckDuckGo's: `https://3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion`) through **multiple Tor relays**
- Use **Tails OS**, a Debian-based Linux distribution designed for anonymity
- Explore **practical privacy measures** like bootable OS environments, digital signature verification, and system memory clearing
- Learn about the intersection of OS security, network anonymization, and open-source tooling

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- **Tails OS** — Live security-focused Linux distribution (from [tails.net](https://tails.net))
- **Tor Browser** — Integrated within Tails for anonymous browsing via Tor relays
- **USB Drive** — Used to install and boot Tails
- **Balena Etcher** — Tool to flash the Tails image onto the USB drive
- **OpenPGP** — Used to verify the authenticity of the downloaded Tails image
- **David Bombal / TCM Security** — Educational resources that guided setup and deepened my understanding

---

## 🔐 Setup Process

1. **Downloaded Tails image** and its `.sig` file from the [official Tails website](https://tails.net)
2. **Verified the image** using OpenPGP to ensure integrity and authenticity
3. Used **Balena Etcher** to flash the verified image onto a USB drive
4. Booted into **Tails OS** from the USB drive
5. Launched **Tor Browser** within Tails
6. Successfully accessed DuckDuckGo’s onion address: `https://3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion` through the Tor network

## ⚙️ How to Create a Tails OS Bootable Drive

Here’s how I set up Tails OS from scratch for this project:

### 1️⃣ Download the Tails ISO

- Open your browser and download the latest **Tails OS ISO image** from the [official Tails website](https://tails.net).

### 2️⃣ Flash the ISO to a USB Drive

- Use the **Balena Etcher** software (or similar) to flash the Tails image onto a USB drive.
- This turns the USB drive into a **bootable Tails drive**.

### 3️⃣ Boot from the USB Drive

- Plug in the bootable USB drive to your computer.
- Restart the computer and enter the **boot menu** by pressing a key during startup (`ESC`, `F2`, or `F12`, depending on your motherboard).

### 4️⃣ Configure the BIOS

- In the boot menu, **select the USB drive** as the boot device.

### 5️⃣ Set Up Tails OS

- Follow the Tails OS prompts to prepare the system for production use.
- Choose language settings, keyboard layout, and connect to the Tor network.

## 🚀 Access the Deep Web

Once booted into Tails:

1. Launch the **Tor Browser** (built into Tails).
2. Visit DuckDuckGo’s .onion mirror: https://3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion
3. Explore other `.onion` services cautiously and anonymously.

## 📈 Challenges Faced

- Configuring and verifying the Tails bootable drive
- Understanding how to route and test Tor connections via relays
- Getting familiar with Tails-specific behaviors (session-based file system, non-persistence)

**Solution:** I followed an in-depth tutorial from cybersecurity expert **David Bombal**, who originally inspired this project through his interviews and practical demonstrations.

---

## 📚 Lessons Learned

### 🌐 Cybersecurity Knowledge
- The **deep web** can contain **serious threats**, including malicious actors—so using recommended precautions is essential.
- Learned how **Tor anonymizes traffic** using layered relays.
- Understood the strict security and anonymity features of **Tails OS**.
- Gained practical knowledge of `.onion` domains and their risks.

### 🧪 Practical Skills
- Verified software integrity with **OpenPGP**.
- Flashed and booted secure **live USB systems**.
- Explored **deep web access** under anonymized, controlled conditions.

---

## 🔄 Future Enhancements

- Set up and configure a personal **non-exit Tor relay node**.
- Explore building a **.onion service** of my own.
- Use **Whonix** or **Qubes OS** to compare different privacy-focused operating systems.
- Begin learning **penetration testing tools** like Metasploit or Nmap inside isolated environments.

---

## 🛠️ Additional Tips

✅ **Verify the ISO signature** (with OpenPGP) to ensure your download is authentic and secure.  
✅ **Always use trusted sources** when downloading privacy-focused OSs and tools.  
✅ **Avoid using personal accounts** or identifying information when exploring the deep web.
